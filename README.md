Clojure Ã -la-carte
=================

Leiningen template to kickstart Clojure applications with REPL-controlled dependencies (startable, stoppable). Based on Stuart Sierra's reloaded pattern.

Includes out-of-the box support for:

* Datomic
* MongoDB
* RabbitMQ
* Jetty webserver
* Remote REPL

## Usage

    $ lein new back-end-template my-app

Define your environments in `application.clj`

During development, type `(user/start)`, `(user/stop)` and `(user/reset)` in the REPL.

In production, the `-main` entry point takes care of starting the system.

In both environments, the components are accessible from the system map, which you call with `(system-map)`.

That's it!
